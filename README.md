# Action Recognition of CSGO

This is repository regarding developing a model for accurate prediction of 4 different actions and compare the performance among the five different transfer learning models with our self-developed deep neural network and identify the best-fitted model and also including major voting later on, which is qualified to provide real time prediction using the video clips of CSGO.
