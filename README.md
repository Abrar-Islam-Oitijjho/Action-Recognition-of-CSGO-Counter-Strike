## About

This project focuses on real-time action recognition in Counter Strike: Global Offensive. The system identifies four key in-game events — kill, death, smoke, and no action — using multiple deep learning architectures. Five transfer learning models (VGG16, Xception, InceptionV3, Inception-ResNet-V2, ResNet152-V2) are evaluated alongside a custom neural network to determine the best performer.

The pipeline is designed to classify actions frame by frame, support real-time inference, and generate structured outputs for downstream prediction models. It also includes an automated module for collecting and processing gameplay video, making it easier to scale datasets and measure action frequency across matches.

This work demonstrates a practical framework for gameplay analytics, player performance assessment, and early-stage prediction of match dynamics using advanced computer vision techniques. This work has been published in IEEE Conference. The link to that can be found in the following section.

## Features

- 🎯 **Action Recognition**: Identifies key actions performed by players in CS:GO, such as shooting, reloading, jumping, and planting/defusing the bomb.
- ⚡ **Performance**: Utilizes efficient data processing techniques to handle large datasets from CS:GO demo files.
- 🛠️ **Extensible**: Designed to be easily extended with new actions and data sources.
- 📊 **Data Analysis**: Provides tools for analyzing gameplay data and extracting meaningful insights.
- 🤖 **Machine Learning**: Employs machine learning algorithms to train models for action recognition.

## Data

Data were collected as DEM formatted files, which are game files and only playable by the  CS: GO game

#### Example input

## Method

<details> <summary><strong>1. System Model</strong></summary>

DEM files were collected from HLTV and converted into 1280×720, 30 FPS video clips.

Each clip contained 2–5 seconds of a specific action.

All clips were manually labeled into four classes: kill, death, smoke, no-action.

The goal was to prepare clean, high-quality input data for downstream processing.

</details>
<details> <summary><strong>2. Data Acquisition and Preprocessing</strong></summary>

Dataset was divided into train, test, and validation sets.

Frames extracted from every clip.

Each frame converted into an array and normalized.

Multiple pre-trained CNN models generated feature vectors for each frame.

Feature vectors were normalized again and reshaped into 1-D formats for model input.

</details>
<details> <summary><strong>3. Model Development</strong></summary>

Five transfer learning models were used for feature extraction:
VGG16, Xception, InceptionV3, Inception-ResNetV2, ResNet152V2.

A custom deep neural network with five hidden layers was trained on extracted features.

Majority voting combined predictions from all five approaches to improve reliability.
