Assalumualaikum sir, I am Abrar from EEE 4th year,. We have chosen 'License Plate Recognition' as our project title.Following is a short view of our work-
""There are 3 code files.First one is template creation, which learns the letters and numbers, means this is the training code.
Second one is plate detection, which detects the plate from the image.
And the last one is letter detection, which detects the letter from the plate using the training experience.

There are other two folders that hold the images.

After keeping the three code files and the other two folders (that hold the images) in the same directory,
if we run the 'plate detection' code file, the code will detect the letters and numbers written in the plate.""
I am still working with the code .Once done,i will share for your reference. I am looking forward to your opinion for our project, and if needed what else can be added.
And I am also interested to learn about machine learning and related things. I have almost finished Andrew Ng's course in coursera on machine learning. What else can I study next? I am looking forward to your reference.
